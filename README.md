# Collatz Conjecture Visualizer

This project was made as both a hello world data visualizations project and a great opportunity to connect with streamlit for interactive opportunities.

This was a rather simple project for me to create, yet I felt it necessary as it established my familiarity with both Streamlit, Medium, and helped me to create an article on my own website.

## How it Works

The Streamlit interactive is based entirely off of `Collatz.py`, and can be accessed [here](collatz-conjecture.streamlit.app). The user can enter an integer into the side bar and view the corresponding graph appear which shows the progression of the value as the relation is recursively applied until it eventually subsides at 1. Below is more information about the interesting properties and patterns of the Collatz relation as well as other resources for additional learning
